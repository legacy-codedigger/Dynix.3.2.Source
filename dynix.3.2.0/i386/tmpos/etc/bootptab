#	first field -- hostname
#			(may be full domain name and probably should be)
#
#	hd -- home directory
#	bf -- bootfile
#	cs -- cookie servers
#	ds -- domain name servers
#	gw -- gateways
#	ha -- hardware address
#	ht -- hardware type
#	im -- impress servers
#	ip -- host IP address
#	lg -- log servers
#	lp -- LPR servers
#	ns -- IEN-116 name servers
#	rl -- resource location protocol servers
#	sm -- subnet mask
#	tc -- template host (points to similar host entry)
#	to -- time offset (seconds)
#	ts -- time servers

# Be careful about including backslashes where they're needed.  Weird (bad)
# things can happen when a backslash is omitted where one is intended.
#
# First, we define a global entry which specifies the stuff every host uses.
