3/12/86	gak	Version 10 SCED firmware changes

	We removed all support for local RAM programs.  The host
	command no longer needs the '~w', '~l' or '~z' commands,
	so these were gutted.  As a consequence, the files
	download.c and bootstrap.c no longer participate in the
	build.  Look for '#ifdef DROPPED_IN_V10' for the pieces
	of parse.c that were affected.

	I also moved the header file for remote.h to this
	directory, as the firmware 'rs' bootstrap is no longer
	supported.

	The note about INCLUDE below can be safely ignored now.



BLAST FROM THE PAST:
	Note: include files marked with INCLUDE have unusual
	search path.  If this directory is moved, then you
	should "grep INCLUDE *.c makefile" and think about what
	you see.
