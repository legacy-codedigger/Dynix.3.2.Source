connected them with another, and to assume among the
powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which
the laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should

What if you don't want the cover sheet?  Nroff has
an option to print only special pages.  In particular,
  nroff -ms -o1- files ...
will begin printing at page 1, and skip page 0, the cover sheet.
If you only want the cover sheet, you need the command
  nroff -ms -o0 files ...
which prints only page zero.  Try printing
only the cover sheet of the file "decl".
Then type "ready" as usual.

The most complex format is the TM (technical memorandum)
format.  If you use that, instead of the IM format,
you get the usual "MEMORANDUM FOR FILE" message.  In addition,
you usually want to specify the TM number, case numbers, and
so forth.  The command line for TM format (which should also
be the first line given) should read:

  .TM memo-no. case-no. filing-no.

so that, for example, the command line

   .TM 75-1274-1 39199 39199-11

indicates a TM number of 75-1274-1, a charging case number
of 39199, and a filing case number of 39199-11.  Suppose the
number for this memo is
 75-1776-1
and the charging and filing cases are both
 12345
Edit the file "decl" for TM format and run it off.

With a TM you want a cover sheet.  The cover sheet doesn't look too
nice when printed on a computer terminal, but you should
know how to set it up so that you can put it on the typesetter,
which does an attractive job of imitating the official  printed
form.  Basically you must make two changes to get a cover sheet
with normal formatting.  First, you should add to each .AU line
the author's room number and extension.  For example,
  .AU "MH 2C-569" "6377"
  M. E. Lesk
indicates that Lesk's room is MH 2C-569 and his extension is 6377.
The room number is enclosed in quotes to indicate that it is one unit,
even though it contains a blank.  The quotes around the extension are
harmless but unnecessary.  Also, you must add the command
  .CS 1 2 3 4 5 6
after the ".AE" line.  The six numbers are (from left to right) the
number of pages of text, number of pages of "other", the total number of
pages, the number of references, the number of figures and the number of
tables.  Try editing the usual file "decl" to indicate that Mr. Jefferson's
room number is MH 2A-111 and his extension is 1776.  Request a cover sheet
with the above meaningless numbers, just to see where they go.
Then run off the document again.

A couple of details about TM formats.
(1) The computer has this habit of putting the real date on things.
Typically BTL authors wish to lie about the date.  There is a command
for this:
  .DA July 4, 1776
will replace the current date everywhere by the specified date.
(2) Also about the date: most people don't like it on each page.
The normal date command is thus:
  .ND July 4, 1776
which says "no date on each page; in the TM heading area where
the date is needed, use July 4, 1776".
Either date command should be placed just after the .TM line.
(3) There may be other keywords.  These are indicated by the sequence
  .OK
  word 1
  word 2
inserted before the .AB line.
All right.  Change "decl" to show a date of July 4, 1776,
using the ".ND" date command; and add as "other keywords"
"Democracy" and "Tyranny".  Then run off ONLY the cover
sheet (remember nroff -ms -o0 file ...?).  End with "ready".

I sat silent some time, then turned to Harris and said:
``My mind is made up.''
Something in my tone struck him; and when he glanced
at my eye and read what was written there, his face paled
perceptibly.  He hesitated a moment, then said:
``Speak.''
I answered, with perfect calmness:
``I WILL ASCEND THE RIFFELBERG.''
If I had shot my poor friend he could not have fallen from
his chair more suddenly.  If I had been his father he
could not have pleaded harder to get me to give up my
purpose.  But I turned a deaf ear to all he said.  When he
perceived at last that nothing could alter my determination,
he ceased to urge, and for a while the deep silence was broken only
by his sobs.  I sat in marble resolution, with my
eyes fixed upon vacancy, for in spirit I was already
wrestling with the perils of the mountains, and my friend sat
gazing at me in adoring admiration through his tears.  At
last he threw himself upon me in a loving embrace and
exclaimed in broken tones:
``Your Harris will never desert you.  We will die together!''
I cheered the noble fellow with praises, and soon his fears
were forgotten and he was eager for the adventure.  He
wanted to summon the guides at once and leave at two in
the morning, as he supposed the custom was; but I explained that nobody
was looking at that hour; and that the start in the dark
was not usually made from the village but
from the first night's resting-place on the mountainside.  I
said we would leave the village at 3 or 4 p.m. on the morrow;
meantime he could notify the guides, and also let the public
know of the attempt which we proposed to make.
.PP
I went to bed, but not to sleep.  No man can sleep when
he is about to undertake one of these Alpine exploits.  I
tossed feverishly all night long, and was glad enough when
I heard the clock strike half past eleven and knew it was
time to get up for dinner.  I rose, jaded and rusty, and went
to the noon meal, where I found myself the center of interest and
curiosity; for the news was already abroad.  It is not
easy to eat calmly when you are a lion, but it is very
pleasant, nevertheless.
.PP
As usual, at Zermatt, when a great ascent is about to be
undertaken, everybody, native and foreign, laid aside his
own projects and took up a good position to observe the
start.  The expedition consisted of 198 persons, including
the mules; or 205, including the cows.
.PP
It was full four o'clock in the afternoon before my cavalcade
was entirely ready.  At that hour it began to move.  In
point of numbers and spectacular effect, it was the most
imposing expedition that had ever marched from Zermatt.
.PP
I commanded the chief guide to arrange the men and
animals in single file, twelve feet apart, and lash them all
together on a strong rope.  He objected that the first two
miles was a dead level, with plenty of room, and that the
rope was never used except in very dangerous places.  But I
would not listen to that.  My reading had taught me that
many serious accidents had happened in the Alps simply
from not having the people tied up soon enough; I was not
going to add one to the list.  The guide then obeyed my
order.
.PP
When the procession stood at ease, roped together, and
ready to move, I never saw a finer sight.  It was 3,122 feet
long - over half a mile; every man but Harris and me was
on foot, and had on his green veil and his blue goggles, and
his white rag around his hat, and his coil of rope over one
shoulder and under the other, and his ice-ax in his belt,
and carried his Alpenstock in his left hand, his umbrella
(closed) in his right, and his crutches slung at his back.
.PP
The burdens of the pack-mules and the horns of the cows
were decked with the Edelweiss and the Alpine rose.
.PP
I and my agent were the only persons mounted.  We
were in the post of danger in the extreme rear, and tied
securely to five guides apiece.  Our armor-bearers carried our
ice-axes, Alpenstocks, and other implements for us.  We
were mounted upon very small donkeys, as a measure of
safety; in time of peril we could straighten our legs and
stand up, and let the donkey walk from under.  Still, I cannot
recommend this sort of animal - at least for excursions
of mere pleasure - because his ears interrupt the view.  I
and my agent possessed the regulation mountaineering costumes,
but concluded to leave them behind.  Out of respect
for the great numbers of tourists of both sexes who would
be assembled in front of the hotels to see us pass, and also
out of respect for the many tourists whom we expected to
encounter on our expedition, we decided to make the
ascent in evening dress.
.PP
At fifteen minutes past four I gave the command to
move, and my subordinates passed it along the line.  The
great crowd in front of the Monte Rosa hotel parted in
twain, with a cheer, as the procession approached; and as
the head of it was filing by I gave the order - unlimber -
make ready - hoist - and with one impulse up went my
half-mile of umbrellas.  It was a beautiful sight, and a total
surprise to the spectators.  Nothing like that had ever been
seen in the Alps before.  The applause it brought forth was
deeply gratifying to me, and I rode by with my plug hat in
my hand to testify my appreciation of it.  It was the only
testimony I could offer, for I was too full to speak.

animals in single file, twelve feet apart, and lash them all
together on a strong rope.  He objected that the first two
miles was a dead level, with plenty of room, and that the
rope was never used except in very dangerous places.  But I
would not listen to that.  My reading had taught me that
many serious accidents had happened in the Alps simply
from not having the people tied up soon enough; I was not
going to add one to the list.  The guide then obeyed my
order.
.PP
When the procession stood at ease, roped together, and
ready to move, I never saw a finer sight.  It was 3,122 feet
long - over half a mile; every man but Harris and me was
on foot, and had on his green veil and his blue goggles, and
his white rag around his hat, and his coil of rope over one
shoulder and under the other, and his ice-ax in his belt,
and carried his Alpenstock in his left hand, his umbrella
(closed) in his right, and his crutches slung at his back.
.PP
The burdens of the pack-mules and the horns of the cows
were decked with the Edelweiss and the Alpine rose.
.PP
I and my agent were the only persons mounted.  We
were in the post of danger in the extreme rear, and tied
securely to five guides apiece.  Our armor-bearers carried our
ice-axes, Alpenstocks, and other implements for us.  We
were mounted upon very small donkeys, as a measure of
safety; in time of peril we could straighten our legs and
stand up, and let the donkey walk from under.  Still, I cannot
recommend this sort of animal - at least for excursions
of mere pleasure - because his ears interrupt the view.  I
and my agent possessed the regulation mountaineering costumes,
but concluded to leave them behind.  Out of respect
for the great numbers of tourists of both sexes who would
be assembled in front of the hotels to see us pass, and also
out of respect for the many tourists whom we expected to
encounter on our expedition, we decided to make the
ascent in evening dress.
.PP
At fifteen minutes past four I gave the command to
move, and my subordinates passed it along the line.  The
great crowd in front of the Monte Rosa hotel parted in
twain, with a cheer, as the procession approached; and as
the head of it was filing by I gave the order - unlimber -
make ready - hoist - and with one impulse up went my
half-mile of umbrellas.  It was a beautiful sight, and a total
surprise to the spectators.  Nothing like that had ever been
seen in the Alps before.  The applause it brought forth was
deeply gratifying to me, and I rode by with my plug hat in
my hand to testify my appreciation of it.  It was the only
testimony I could offer, for I was too full to speak.

Sorry, that wasn't right.

To see exactly what you are doing, after
making your insertions, compare the file
with file "Ref" using "diff".

OK, maybe you'll get a chance to do it over:

When you have some document typed in "-ms" style,
you run it off on your terminal by saying:

  nroff -ms file

where "file" is the name of the file it is on.  For example,
the file "decl" in this directory is in a suitable format
for running off this way.  Do so.  Then type "ready".

The file "decl" began with ".PP".  All files sent
to -ms MUST begin with a "-ms" command line.  You can
tell these command lines, in general, because they
begin with a period and have only capital letters on them.
The ".PP" command indicates a new paragraph.
So to add another paragraph to a file, you put a ".PP"
in front and then type in the new text.  Here is the
next paragraph of the declaration of independence.  Add
it to the end of the file "decl" that you've been working
with.  You can do that most easily by picking up the text
from file "para2", or you can type it in again.  It is
not necessary to keep every word on exactly
the line it was, since the program will rearrange them.
But the ".PP" must be on a line by itself.  Then
run off the the new version.
