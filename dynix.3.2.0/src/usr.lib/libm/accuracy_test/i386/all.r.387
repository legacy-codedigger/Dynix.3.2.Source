test of tanh(x) vs tanh(x-1/8)+tanh(1/8)/(1+tanh(x-1/8)tanh(1/8)

2000 random arguments were tested from the interval 
    (              0.125,  0.54930614433405491) 

tanh(x) was larger 845 times 
            agreed 406 times and 
       was smaller 749 times.

there are 53 base 2 significant digits in a floating-point number

test of underflow for very small argument. 

tanh( 1.8218319894452515e-231 ) = 1.8218319894452515e-231

the function tanh will be called with the argument 1.797693134862315e+308

tanh( 1.797693134862315e+308 ) =                  1

the function tanh will be called with the argument 2.2250738585072023e-308

tanh( 2.2250738585072023e-308 ) = 2.2250738585072023e-308

the function tanh will be called with the argument                  0

tanh(                  0 ) =                  0

this concludes the tests
