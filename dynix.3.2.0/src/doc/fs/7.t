We thank Robert Elz for his ongoing interest in the new file system,
and for adding disk quotas in a rational and efficient manner.
We also acknowledge Dennis Ritchie for his suggestions
on the appropriate modifications to the user interface.
We appreciate Michael Powell's explanations on how
the DEMOS file system worked;
many of his ideas were used in this implementation.
Special commendation goes to Peter Kessler and Robert Henry for acting
like real users during the early debugging stage when files were
less stable than they should have been.
Finally we thank our sponsors,
the National Science Foundation under grant MCS80-05144,
and the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DoD) under
Arpa Order No. 4031 monitored by Naval Electronic System Command under
Contract No. N00039-82-C-0235.
