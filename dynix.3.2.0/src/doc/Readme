This directory tree contains sources for documents ported from existing
4.2BSD Users Manuals, Volumes 1, 2A, 2B, and 2C.

"ccsmake install" in this directory invokes "ccsmake install" in each
subdirectory of this directory.  "ccsmake install" in those directories
causes the files from that directory to be copied over to a
corresponding place in the "/tmpos/..." tree.  Some files exist in
these directories that do NOT get copied over; they are to support the
"ccsmake print" operation (described later).

"ccsmake clean" in this directory blows away all document source files
from "/tmpos/...".  Subdirectories do not support the "ccsmake clean"
operation.

"ccsmake print" in this directory invokes "ccsmake print"
in each subdirectory of this directory.  "ccsmake print" in those
directories cause each document or manpage to be printed on the Imagen.

"ccsmake print.man" and "ccsmake print.doc" format the manpages and
Volume 2 papers separately, respectively.  Similarly, "ccsmake
install.man" and "ccsmake install.doc" install manpages or papers
separately.
