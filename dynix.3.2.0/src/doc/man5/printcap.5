.SH NAME
printcap \- printer capability data base
.SH SYNOPSIS
/etc/printcap
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Printcap
is a simplified version of the
.IR termcap (5)
data base
used to describe line printers.  The spooling system accesses the
.I printcap
file every time it is used, allowing dynamic
addition and deletion of printers.  Each entry in the data base
is used to describe one printer.  This data base may not be
substituted for, as is possible for 
.IR termcap ,
because it may allow accounting to be bypassed.
.PP
The default printer is normally 
.IR lp ,
though the environment variable PRINTER
may be used to override this.  Each spooling utility supports an option,
.BI \-P printer,
to allow explicit naming of a destination printer.
.PP
Refer to the
.ul
4.2BSD Line Printer Spooler Manual
for a complete discussion on how setup the database for a given printer.
.SH CAPABILITIES
Refer to
.IR termcap (5)
for a description of the file layout.
The
.I printcap
format extends the
.I termcap
format as follows:
if a numeric field contains a leading zero, the field is interpreted as
an octal integer; otherwise, the field is interpreted as a decimal integer.

.fi
.PP
Error messages sent to the console have a carriage return and a line
feed appended to them, rather than just a line feed.
.PP
If the local line printer driver supports indentation, the daemon
must understand how to invoke it.
.SH "NOTES"
Specifying the same line for the "lp" field of more than one printer 
may cause output corruption. No more than one printer should have a
particular line in it's "lp" field.
