.TH VTROFF 1 "\*(V)" "4BSD"
.SH NAME
vtroff \- troff to a raster plotter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vtroff
[
.B \-w
] [
\f3\-F\f1 majorfont
] [
\f3\-123\f1 minorfont
] [
\f3\-l\f2length\f1
] [
.B \-x
] troff arguments
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vtroff
runs
.IR troff (1)
sending its output through various programs
to produce typeset output on a raster plotter
such as a Benson-Varian or or a Versatec.
The
.B \-W
option specifies that a wide output device be used; the default
is to use a narrow device.
The
.B \-l
(lower case l) option causes the output to be split onto successive pages
every
.I length
inches rather than the default 11''.
.PP
The default font is a Hershey font.  If some other font is desired
you can give a
.B \-F
argument and then the font name.  This will place normal, italic and
bold versions of the font on positions 1, 2, and 3.
To place a font only on a single position, you can give an argument of
the form
.B \-\f2n\f1
and the minor font name.  A \f3.r\f1 will be added to the minor
font name if needed.  Thus ``vtroff \-ms paper'' will set a paper
in the Hershey font, while ``vtroff \-F nonie \-ms paper''
will set the paper in the (sans serif) nonie font.
The 
.B \-x
option asks for exact simulation of photo-typesetter output.
(I.e. using the width tables for the C.A.T. photo-typesetter)

.SH BUGS
Since some macro packages work correctly only if the fonts
named R, I, B, and S are mounted, and since the Versatec fonts
have different widths for individual characters than the fonts
found on the typesetter, the following dodge was necessary:
If you don't use the ``.fp'' troff directive
then you get the widths of the standard typesetter fonts
suitable for shipping the output of
troff over the network to the computer center A machine for phototypesetting.
If, however, you remount the R, I, B and S fonts, then you get
the width tables for the Versatec.
