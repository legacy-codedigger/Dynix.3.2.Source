.SH DESCRIPTION
The two files are
compared.
(If
.I file1
is `\-',
the standard input is used.)
Under default options,
.I cmp
makes no comment if the files are the same;
if they differ, it announces the byte and line number
at which the difference occurred.
If one file is an initial subsequence
of the other, that fact is noted.

files, 1 for different files, and 2 for an
inaccessible or missing argument.
