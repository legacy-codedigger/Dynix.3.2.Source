This directory contains source for most of the
documents contained in Volume 2 of The UNIX
Programmer's Manual.  Most use -ms to format;
many also use refer, tbl and eqn. Precise incantations
are engraved in ./run.

The citations for those papers that use
refer are taken from /usr/dict/papers/Rv7man.
