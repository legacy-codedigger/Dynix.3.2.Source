.SH NAME
mktemp \- make a unique file name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mktemp
creates a unique file name, typically in a temporary filesystem,
by replacing
.I template
with a unique file name, and returns the
address of the template.
The template should contain a file name with six trailing
X's, which are replaced with the
current process id and a unique letter.
.I Mkstemp
makes the same replacement to the template
but returns a file descriptor
for the template file open for reading and writing.
.I Mkstemp
avoids the race between testing whether the
file exists and opening it for use.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
getpid(2), open(2)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.I Mkstemp
returns an open file descriptor upon success.
It returns "\/" if no suitable file could be created.
