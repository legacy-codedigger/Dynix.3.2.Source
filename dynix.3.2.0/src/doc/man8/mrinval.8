.SH NAME
mrinval \- invalidate a mirror unit's label
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/mrinval
.IR unit " [" "unit ..." ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B mrinval
command invalidates each named mirror unit's label by updating the
modification time stored in the device inode to the current time. If a unit
has been used in one mirror and you want to use it in a different
mirror, use this command to invalidate the unit's label first.
You can also use this command to manually invalidate a mirror unit
in order to forcibly resynchronize the mirror with the
.B mirror
command.
