.SH NAME
lpc \- line printer control program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/etc/lpc
[ command [ argument ... ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lpc

operation of the line printer system.

.IP \(bu
disable or enable a printer's spooling queue,
.IP \(bu

Without any arguments,
.I lpc
will prompt for commands from the standard input.
If arguments are supplied,
.IR lpc
interprets the first argument as a command and the remaining
arguments as parameters to the command.  The standard input
may be redirected causing
.I lpc
to read commands from file.
Commands may be abbreviated;
the following is the list of recognized commands.
